The Oxford Limiter Hybrid Skin 44 AU Presets are compatible with any DAW that supports AU plugins, such as Logic Pro, GarageBand, Ableton Live, Cubase and more. To use them, you need to have the Oxford Limiter plugin installed on your computer. You can download it from the Sonnox website[^1^]. Once you have installed the plugin, you can load the presets from the plugin's menu or from your DAW's browser. You can also tweak the presets to your liking using the plugin's parameters, such as threshold, release, enhance, recon and dither.
 
Here are some tips on how to use the presets effectively:
 
- Choose a preset that matches the genre and style of your music. For example, if you are working on a rock song, you might want to try the Rock Mastering preset or the Rock Drums Bus preset.
- Adjust the input gain of the plugin so that the input meter shows a healthy level without clipping. You can also use the auto gain feature to automatically match the input and output levels.
- Use the output meter and the recon meter to monitor the output level and the true peak level of your signal. The recon meter shows the actual rather than sampled signal and helps you avoid reconstruction overloads that can cause distortion. You can also use the auto comp feature to automatically correct any recon errors without losing overall loudness.
- Use the enhance knob to add some extra loudness and density to your signal. The enhance function applies a musical boost that increases apparent loudness without affecting peak level or introducing artifacts. Be careful not to overdo it though, as too much enhancement can make your signal sound unnatural or harsh.
- Use the dither section to apply dithering and noise shaping to your signal when exporting it to a lower bit depth format. The plugin offers four types of dithering (flat TPDF, normal TPDF, normal shaped and high pass shaped) and four types of noise shaping (none, low dynamic range, medium dynamic range and high dynamic range). You can audition and apply dithering from the plugin's menu or from your DAW's export settings.

The SONNOX Oxford Limiter Hybrid Skin 44 AU Presets are a great way to get started with limiting and enhancing your mixes. They offer a range of options and settings that can suit different musical needs and tastes. You can also use them as a starting point for creating your own custom presets. With the Oxford Limiter plugin and its hybrid skin presets, you can achieve professional sounding results that will make your music stand out.
